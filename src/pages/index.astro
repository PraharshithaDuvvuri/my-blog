      <p>
        I&apos;m a passionate software engineer skilled in Java, JavaScript,
        React, Next.js, and Node.js. My love for data structures matches my
        caffeine addiction. I thrive on daily challenges, transforming
        complexity into efficient code. From creating stunning UIs to optimizing
        backend systems, I constantly innovate and improve. Coding is my
        passion, fueled by coffee and a drive to solve problems, debug bugs, and
        build new features.

        When I&apos;m not busy brewing the perfect cup of coffee, you can find
        me buried under a pile of half-finished projects and coding experiments.
        Developing for fun and caffeine-fueled creativityâ€”because who needs
        sleep when you have endless ideas and espresso?
